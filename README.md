# Multi-Stage-Variational-Autoencoders-for-Hierarchical-Molecular-Generation-and-Activity-Optimization
we propose a multi-stage VAE framework that hierarchically learns molecular representations through pro- gressive encodingâ€“decoding stages. Each stage refines the latent space, allowing the model to preserve structural integrity while enhancing novelty and uniqueness.
